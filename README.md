# ACExpertAdvisor
A C#.NET dynamic expert advisor with GUI app for realtime auto-trading algorithm adjustment

MetaTrader allows the creation and execution of automatic currency trading algorithms called expert advisors.
These expert advisors are written in MQL, a proprietary C-based scripting language created by the MetaTrader platform.

This project utilizes the NQuotes expert advisor library which interfaces with the MetaTrader MQL format.

ACExpertAdvisor is an abstraction layer to the NQuotes expert advisor which allows a completely custom, dynamic, and realtime 
implementation of the expert advisor's core logic and functionality. The goal of this application is to build a powerful and 
intuitive front-end GUI application for creating, adjusting, and executing automatic trading algorithms.
